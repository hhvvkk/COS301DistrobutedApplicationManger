\section{Overview}
\subsection{Background}
The CSIR is actively developing a distributed simulation framework that ties
in with various other real systems and is used to exchange information
between them. The client has a number of configurations of this system
depending on the requirements of the client which can involve various
external applications as well.\\
\textbf{\\}
One of the issues the client has is to quickly distribute the latest build or
configuration files of their software over various computers that are needed
for an experiment. In some cases the same computers may be used for other
experiments which mean each of the computers may need to have various
builds and configuration options.\\
\textbf{\\}
Another issue they experience is the running, stopping and restarting of
the complete simulation. During a simulation it may be determined that
certain configuration options may need to be changed and distributed to the
affected machines, in which case either all or some components will need to
be restarted which can become tedious and time consuming.
\subsection{Business opportunity}
The goal of our project is to develop an application which is able to maintain
various build versions of the simulation framework and distribute these builds
to certain designated machines that may be required for an experiment. The
application will monitor system statistics of the various machines attached
to an experiment and will have the ability to execute applications on those
machines which will have different configuration options.\\
\textbf{\\}
The application will consist of a master and slave component where the
master is used to control the distribution of slaves. From the master one will
be able to start an experiment which will run the relevant applications on all
the necessary machines.

\section{Purpose of this document}
This document is intended to assist users of the application, known as AppMan and AppManClient, with neccessary tasks.



\section{Server use}

\subsection{Start Server}
The server is started automatically, but after a manual stop can be restarted maually as follows:

\subsection{Stop Server}
The server can be stopped using this menu item:

\subsection{Set Port}
The port can be changed from the default, effect will be taken when the server is restarted via a stop then start. The process looks as follows:

\section{Build related}

\subsection{Add Build to AppMan (Master)}
A build can be added on the master as follows, all the info, except build description is compulsory.

\subsection{Copy Build to AppManClient (Slave)}
The build can be copied in the following way:

\section{Simulation related}

\subsection{Add Simulation}
To add a simulation one must have at least one slave added. The available slaves are displayed as checkbox items. A build or application can then be selected via a drop down box. If necessary command line arguments are then typed in. Once all the information is captured one can add the simulation. See below:

\subsection{Execute Simulation}
A simulation can be selected on the treewidget, then double-click the selected simulation. This will send the argument and required build or application name over the network, along with the command line arguments to the necessary slave. See below:

\section{Machine related}

\subsection{Add Slave}
On the AppManClient one sets the port and Master IP then clicks connect. These are then stored in a settings file for future use. 

\subsection{Request System Information}
When a slave is clicked the request is automatically sent to the slave, then displayed in a docking widget as follows.

\section{AppManClient}

\subsection{Add Build}
Adding a build on the client side works as follows:

\subsection{Add Application to AppList}
This is done for preinstalled programs and works as follows:

\subsection{View builds}
When the button is clicked, all builds and applications are displayed in a new window. See below:
